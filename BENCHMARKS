I've performed some simple benchmarks just to see how I'm doing.

For this I'm running an unoptimized Mandelbrot renderer and comparing
with other schemes.  So far, I do:

- time ../mickey mandelbrot.scm
- time csi -bq mandelbrot.scm    # Chicken scheme, interpreted
- csc -O5 mandelbrot.scm -o mandelbrot && time ./mandelbrot # ditto, compiled

BENCHMARK HISTORY

== 2011-05-02 ==
This is the first time that Mickey actually would run the Mandelbrot
program.  Actually not TOO bad, considering we don't do TCO or JIT,
and that the code is otherwise completely unoptimized. :)

Program     User     Time/fastest
---------------------------------
mickey -g   2.527s   34.1x
mickey -O6  0.921s   12.4x
csi -bq     0.136s    1.8x
csc -O5     0.074s    1.0x

Anyway, at this point, it's more important to build a *correct* scheme.
