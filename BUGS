--- append() in primops.cpp IS STILL MUTABLE, see old revision and fix.
TO see the bug:
> (define a (list 1))
> (append a 2)
> (append a 3)
a will be mutated... this also affects stuff like tests/curry.scm

--- Charmap not full, cannot set whitespace chars, e.g.
"#\ " does not work, but should.

--- Does not check operator:
> (1 2 3)
1

Should be an error

--- String parsing is incomplete (should demand complete parse)
0> (display "error )
"ERROR 1> 
2>
