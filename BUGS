--- Parsing of characters (section 6.3.4 in r7rs 3rd draft), doesn't work with #\) and #\(
--- because of the way the parser is currently built.  E.g.:

mickey> (display #\))
Exception: Unbound variable: #\
Backtrace:
 - (display #\)

=> This can only be fixed by making #\ a known delimiter at the first parsing stage.

--- Space "#\ " can work with ANY non-printable character in last position, e.g. type
    "#\<CTRL+V, TAB>" will give a space.  This is a bug, although a very subtle one.

--- Does not check operator:
> (1 2 3)
1

Should be an error, because `1Â´ is not a function that takes arguments.

--- (run-tests) does not work

Doesn't work because of CATCH_ALL macro is not defined for NO_EXCEPTIONS.

--- Running "./mickey tests/tests.scm" does not find complex.scm and CHOKES
