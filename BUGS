BUGS
* Should be false: (list? '(a . b)) but is true b/c "." is considered an atom
* Crashes: (gcd 32 -36) -> because it's negative
* Can't do negative modulus operations
* Can't parse +nan.0
* Should be true: mickey> (integer? 3.0)
* Can't parse real number -2.5+0.0i
* Can't parse real number #e1e10
* Can't parse +inf.0
* Can't parse infix integer expression 8/4
* This must work: `(a `(b ,foo)) ==> (a (quasiquote (b (unquote * foo))))
* Hangs: mickey> 'a
* Unsupported: '#(1 2 3)
* N quotes should equal one: mickey> ''''a ; should be same as 'a
* Hairy implementation of mickey> '()
* Cannot parse #\) or #\(, e.g.: mickey> (display #\))
* Space "#\ " can work with ANY non-printable character in the last
  position, e.g. "#\<CTRL+V+TAB>" will also give a space.  This is because
  of the strange parser implementation
