Bugs (so far) in Mickey Scheme

* Hangs: mickey> 'a
* Unsupported: '#(1 2 3)
* N quotes should equal one: mickey> ''''a ; should be same as 'a
* Hairy implementation of mickey> '()
* Cannot parse #\) or #\(, e.g.: mickey> (display #\))
* Space "#\ " can work with ANY non-printable character in the last
  position, e.g. "#\<CTRL+V+TAB>" will also give a space.  This is because
  of the strange parser implementation
