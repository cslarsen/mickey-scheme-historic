- let-forms
- tail call elimination

EASY
- Add character parsing, #\f for instance
- Add character table
- Add division
- Add decimal arithmetic functions
  - SUB
  - DIV
- Implement Mandelbrot example

NORMAL
- Make doubly and triply sure that environment/closure/lexical scoping ACTUALLY WORKS
- Make doubly and triply sure that lambda ACTUALLY WORKS

- We're now a proper Lisp/Scheme, celebrate!
  * OOOH, almost there!!
    * Summary:  We have variadic lambdas, closures with lexical scoping (I think)...
                what does that make us?????? A REAL LISP!!! :D :D :D
                Though we ARE missing a lot of important stuff... so we're a lisp,
                but don't have a working GC, TCO/TCE, macros, and there are prolly
                LOTS of bugs as well in the existing stuff... Also, we don't have
                (let)-forms, but these can be made with lambdas (SICP explains this).

- After we're a lisp/scheme (basic version)
  * Make A LOT of test-functions, test everything again and again,
    test edge cases, look up all the subtle stuff and create tests for them,
    we will aim for complete compliance with spec...

- Add let, letrec, fluid-rec etc

HARDER
- Add library functions
- Add libffi support
- Add llvm primitives in scheme
- Craft llvm compiler (in scheme?)
- Add (fast) vector/SSE support through #(1 2 3)
- Add parallelization support (through some lib; see comp benchmarks game)
- Check up Hewitt's actor model, how it was solved in scheme
- Add support for continuation
- Add support for first class continuations
- Add support for delay/force

NEXT STEPS
- Make all llvm primitives callable by interpreter
  => implement functions as llvm primitives, e.g.:

    (define display
      (lambda (p)
        (while (not (null? p))
          (begin
            (if (not (pair? p))
              (ffi:printf "%s" (->c_string p))
              (display (eval (car p))))
            (set! p (cdr p))))))

  Some functions must be built-in, I guess, like "no", "null?", "->c_string" and so on.
  But perhaps later on, these can as well become something that can be implemented (?).
  (At least many of them).

DOWN THE LINE
- Add utf-8 support for strings, consider making it default
- Tail-call optimization
- call/cc
- delay/force
- Macros
