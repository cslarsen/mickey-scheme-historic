NEXT STEPS
- Add support for (define), simple variable placeholder
- Add support for environment / lexical closure, use with (define) above
- Add support for (lambda), use with closure and define above
  => now we're a *real* Lisp!
- Add (import) for reading other files
- Make all llvm primitives callable by interpreter
  => implement functions as llvm primitives, e.g.:

    (define display
      (lambda (p)
        (while (not (null? p))
          (begin
            (if (not (pair? p))
              (ffi:printf "%s" (->c_string p))
              (display (eval (car p))))
            (set! p (cdr p))))))

  Some functions must be built-in, I guess, like "no", "null?", "->c_string" and so on.
  But perhaps later on, these can as well become something that can be implemented (?).
  (At least many of them).
