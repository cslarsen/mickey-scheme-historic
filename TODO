- libscheme-base.so is both loaded dynamically and statically linked in via
object files.  Moved all eval-internal procs to this module and make it 100%
dynamically loaded.

- This does not work:
#; mickey> (define a '(1 2 3))
#; mickey> `(+ ,@a 10)
(+ 10)

Should return (+ 1 2 3 10)

It works by doing it literally, `(+ ,@(list 1 2 3) 10) gives (+ 1 2 3 10)

Random stuff:
- Funker i chibi men ikke i mickey
> (define a (list 1 2 3))
> (set-cdr! (cdr a) 99)
> a
(1 2 . 99)

- This is a bug:
#; mickey> (cons (cons 1 2) (cons 3 4))
((1 . 2) 3 . 4)

- "define" and friends should be exported by (scheme base), so that e.g.
  prefixing them with base: would mean you would have to do (base:define
  ...), so fix that.
- If backtrace() has only one entry in REPL, don't print it
- Create a library (mickey defmacro) with straight expansion, like
  (defmacro (my-unless condition body)
    `(if (not ,condition)
       (begin ,@body))) ; see what the function signature
       ; for defmacro is in norvig's jscheme
- See how MIT Scheme present first class environments to the user.
  Also see in the T book how they do it.
- In symbol(...), add assert_identifier(...) to check that we have a
  legal name for an identifier (e.g., no spaces, etc).  Could optionally
  also be done in the parser.
- For all functions, record arity somewhere (and, optionally, expected
  types), so that we can easily (and statically) detect errors.
- Lib: (scheme base) should refer to lib/scheme/base.scm
- eval() shold only intercept scheme core symbols, because of
  shadowing.
- Now that we have syntactic:bool in named_function_t, move functions
  from eval out to modules.
- In primitives.cpp symbol(...), don't seem to use environment to store
  symbols, meaning we have a global symbol table.  This should be in
  symbol-table.h or something like that, and should be fast(er) to
  lookup.  Also, remove the environment_t param from symbol("lala", e)
  since it's not needed.  Also, for string and symbol, it should suffice
  with pointer comparison with global tables.
- REPL: Add context-sensitive tab-completion, with double tab to cycle
  through alternatives.. e.g. (im<tab> -> (import and then
  (import (sch<tab> should give you (import (scheme, and then
  (import (scheme <tab>)) should give you a list of the scheme libraries.
- If we define identical symbols in two modules and import both, we should
  generate an appropriate error message.
- Rename module_blabla to module-blabla or library-blabla
- What happens if foo.scm contains (load "foo.scm") ? We should detect this.
- Should have a mutable list of internal and external lib names ("scheme
  base" . "base.scm" og externals_base)
- Create cxr.h and cxr.scm lib
- Does this work "#\ " (for space) ?
- Make current-*-port parameter-objects
- In {"make-string", proc_make_string}, use a struct to indicate if function
  should be syntactic so that args will not be evlis'ed
- Add func null_environment(int version = 7) that returns blank environment
  with only "import" defined
- Add func that returns typical repl environment
- If a C/.so scheme library contains some code in scheme form, then itself
  should be responsible to proc_load("file.scm") (so, we need a module api
  and init functions)
- ./mickey file.scm should have a completely empty environent except for
  (import), but eval has hardcoded some symbols, so fix that. (The way to do
  it is to move the core stuff into base library and mark the procedures as
  syntax (not normal syntax expand, but functions whose arguments are not
  evaluated)
- Fix (import) to handle multiple import statements (import (scheme base) (scheme write))
- Fix (import) to correctly exclude, rename, etc
- Make a C module system first, a la Python, with dynamic compiled
  libraries, to write a module you just include "mickey-api.h" and then
  you have cons and all that stuff and all the function signatures.
  Dynamically compiled modules must export name of library, symbols,
  etc and be fully compatible with the existing source level module
  system, etc.
- Add PORT type
- Add COMPLEX support
- For numbers, add bool exact field, enable for exact ops
- For all cons cells, add bool constant field, enable for constant lists
  like '(foo bar
- Add full number format support in parser
- Add support for wide chars (wprintf, std::wstring, etc)
- Count linenumbers in parser and use that in exceptions (add filename and
  linenumber to exceptions as own fiels?)
- BUG: Cannot parse consecutive strings like "a""b""c"; the tokenizer should
       emit three tokens in that situation: "a", "b" and "c" to remedy the
       situation.  A good test that this is supported is to perform
       these tests:
       (length '(#;"a""b""c")) should return 2
       (length '("a"#;"b""c""d""e")) should return 4

List of what is most important to get a full r7rs system:
- call/cc, because lots of lib stuff depends on it
- proper syntax-rules with correct ... and :::, because
  many lib forms can use this for implementation
- correct module system, so that libs can be formalized

Other stuff:
-- This should be legal: (let ((=> #f)) (cond (#t => 'ok))) because of
   hygiene (see r7rs example on this, it should recognize => as a local
   variable and then allow its use)
-- Fiks at REPL viser '()
-- Fiks syntax match på bugs/macro4.scm
-- Fjern append() overalt det finnes
-- Lag SYMBOL-TABLE slik at ALLE symboler som har samme navn peker
   til samme globale symbol.
-- Lag enkel PRE-PARSER av kodesnutter som OVERSETTER (dvs enkel
   kompilering) feks alle slike symboler slik de peker på samme
   symbol, og at visse variabel-referanser ikke bruker lookup()
   men peker direkte med peker til variabelen som refereres osv.
   Dette er ganske safe optimaliseringer, men gjør at interpretation
   går mye raskere.

Now:
- repl> '() does not print anything, so fix that
- try to simplify print.cpp
- refactor the parser, extract methods into files (parse-string.cpp,
  parse-quotation.cpp etc) and add a table of tokens ("(", ")", "'", "#(",
  "#|", ...) etc and generally clean up

- BUG: (length (cons 1 2)) ==> 2 but should be an error
- Add primitives.cpp unspecified_value() or something that we use everywhere
  where values are unspecified.  (Sometimes it makes sense in
  implementations to return actually diverse set of values for unspecifieds,
  but it's not a bad idea to mark these spots... so we could do
  unspecified() to return a default unspecified value, or unspecified(123)
  to MARK this as an unspecified return value but return 123 nevertheless.

Fix 1:
#; mickey> (cons 1 2)
1 . 2

but should display (1 . 2).  See listp() and pairp(), and/or sprint.

Fix 2:

#; mickey> '(1. 2)
(1 2)

Should return (1 . 2) or the same as (cons 1 2).

- BUG: (cdr '(a . b)) should return (b) and not (. b)
- FEATURE: Support for let-syntax
- Quotation-parser is broken, e.g. can't do "Just say \"Yes!\" please"
- BUG, VARIADIC FUNCTIONS: Now I'm looking for the dot in the input
  arguments, but the CORRECT way of doing that is to let the reader
  translate a "first . rest" into "(cons first rest)" so we get an
  improper list.  This alleviates the need to handle dots, and will
  also make it easier system-wide to handle variadic functions (e.g.,
  in double macro invocation, variadic functions arguments will
  "expand" correctly).
- Support for non-syntax rules() define-syntax (if allowed in r7rs)
  (it just says "it SHOULD be syntax-rules")
- BUG: Detection of proper list/circular lists must be done in many lisp functions
- UTF8 support
- Think about constancy, like a quoted list like '(1 2 3). Should we mark it
  as constant?  What does the draft say about this?
- This '#(1 2 foo) parses to (quote (vector(1 2 foo))).  NOt sure if that's
  correct, or whether the ' just means it's a constant-vector
- Problem with "repl> '(1 . 3)" as it does not produce ONE pair with CAR->1
  and CDR->3.  But "(let ((v (list 1 2))) (set-cdr! v 3))" DOES produce a
  proper pair with CAR->1 and CDR->3.
- Allow #true and #false as #t and #f, but currently we can to #tfoo and
  #ffoo, so fix that
- Apparently, this is not allowed in r7rs: "1.2f" to donate floats, or "2f"
- Allow |foo bar| identifiers, e.g. (define (|hello world| message) (display message))
- Enforce rules for names of definitions. E.g., this is not ok: (define (1+ num) (+ 1 num))
- Regarding vectors passed to functions expecting lists, find out the
  exact differences... i.e., read up on vectors

RANDOM STUFF

NEXT STEPS, SHOULD BE ORDERED BY INCREASING DIFFICULTY
- In closure_t, add "cons_t *args, *body" instead of using __args__ and __body__
- Add module system (module, export, import, etc)
- Put as many functions as possible into the base module
- Add let-syntax
- Fix define-syntax / syntax rules: LOTS of bugs in the macro system
- Add more recognized patterns in syntax-rules
- Add letrec*
- Add let-values
- Add let*-values
- Fix native string type; using C-string doesn't work with make-string 10 #\nul
- Add simple mark-and-sweep GC (simple; currently not needed)
- Look into exact->inexact stuff
- Add continuation passing style (CPS) transform for all code
- Refactor the code, it's A MESS at the moment...
- Fix expt for fractional exponents
- Add support for continuations
- Add call/cc
- Add support for first class continuations
- Add memoization to lazy evaluation form
- Add UTF8 support for strings
- Add UTF8 support for define names (if allowed by r7rs)

LATER / HARDER
- Add library functions
- Add libffi support
- Add llvm primitives in scheme
- Craft llvm compiler (in scheme?)
- Add (fast) vector/SSE support through #(1 2 3)
- Add parallelization support (through some lib; see comp benchmarks game)

LLVM
Make all llvm primitives callable by interpreter, i.e.
implement functions as llvm primitives, e.g.:

  (define display
    (lambda (p)
      (while (not (null? p))
        (begin
          (if (not (pair? p))
            (ffi:printf "%s" (->c_string p))
            (display (eval (car p))))
          (set! p (cdr p))))))

Some functions must be built-in, I guess, like "no", "null?", "->c_string"
and so on.  But perhaps later on, these can as well become something that
can be implemented (?).  (At least many of them).
